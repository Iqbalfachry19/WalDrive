# WalDrive

## Project Description

**WalDrive** is a decentralized file storage and sharing platform built on the Sui blockchain.

It allows users to securely upload, store, and share files while maintaining privacy and ownership. Users retain full control over their data, and sensitive files can be protected using encryption and optional privacy-preserving technologies.

WalDrive leverages blockchain verification to ensure file integrity and provides trustless access management for shared content.

## WalDriveNFT Integration

Once a user uploads or interacts with files, they can mint an NFT as a proof of ownership or access using the companion NFT project:

👉 [WalDriveNFT GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Iqbalfachry19/WalDriveNFT)

This NFT acts as an on-chain credential, signaling verified ownership or permission for a file or folder.
